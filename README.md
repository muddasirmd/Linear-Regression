# Linear-Regression

### When To Use
1. How strong the relationship is between two variables (e.g. the relationship between rainfall and soil erosion).
2. The value of the dependent variable at a certain value of the independent variable (e.g. the amount of soil erosion at a certain level of rainfall).
### Pros
1. Easier to implement, interpret and efficient to train
2. low computational power
3. low Time Complexity
4. fits linearly seperable datasets almost perfectly and is often used to find the nature of the relationship between variables.
### Cons
1. Prone to noise and overfitting
2. Sensitive to outliers
